## Evolutionary Computation Projects
Overview
This repository contains various projects related to evolutionary computation, developed as part of the Evolutionary Computations course at Cracow University of Technology. The projects encompass different algorithms and heuristics such as genetic algorithms, evolutionary strategies, and other heuristic optimization techniques.

### Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- P1 - Contains the implementation of example crossover methods for binary representation chromosome.
- P2 - Includes implementation of GUI application for genetic algorithm(binary representation).
- P3 - Contains the implementation of example crossover methods for real representation chromosome.
- P4 - Includes implementation of GUI application for evolutionary algorithm(real representation).

###  Getting Started

Python 3.x
Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt)
#### Installation

`git clone https://github.com/pepeni/OE.git`

`cd OE`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
